# About Cory

<center><img src="/assets/img/cory_and_corgi.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>


 I'm a recent PhD graduate from [Alan Bergland's lab](http://bergland-lab.org) in the Biology department at the University of Virginia. My work at UVA involved computational methods development and analysis of simulated and real-world large-scale genetic data to address questions about ecology and evolution. Read more about my research [here](research.html) or check out my [CV](assets/docs/CAWeller_CV.pdf).

I received my B.A. in Biology at [Gustavus Adolphus College](https://www.gustavus.edu) in Saint Peter, MN. After graduating, I worked as a quarantine lab technician for the American Red Cross.

I recently taught the first course of my own design, [*Introduction to Computational Biology*](https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585)! Learn more at my page on [teaching](/teaching.html).

I'm a passionate about cooking, dedicated to weight training, enjoy the occasional [spartan race](spartan.html).

## Computational Proclivities
  * work primarily done in `R`, `bash` and `python`
  * `vim` over `emacs`, `data.table` over `dplyr`
  * practicing `julia` on the side
  * sufficient `HTML` & `CSS` to code up this site
  * sufficient `LaTeX` to typeset my [CV](assets/docs/CAWeller_CV.pdf)
