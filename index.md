My name's Cory. I'm a recent PhD graduate from [Alan Bergland's lab](http://bergland-lab.org) in the Biology department at the University of Virginia. My work at UVA involved the analysis of simulated and real-world large-scale genetic data to address questions about ecology and evolution.

Take a look around, read more [about me](about_me.html), read up on my [research projects](research.html) and [teaching experience](teaching.html), or have a peek at my [CV](assets/docs/CAWeller_CV.pdf)!
